          observe first, understand deeply, test limits, iterate, and keep going.

          Right now, I’m actively looking for a full-time role or internship in UX / UI / Product Design,

            <h2>My Story — Beyond UX</h2>

            <p>
              Before UX, before design tools, before wireframes — there was movement.
              I’ve always believed the human body is capable of far more than we assume.
              You just have to test it. Repeatedly.
            </p>

            <h3>It Started With Speed</h3>
            <p>
              In school, I was into athletics — running and long jump. I wasn’t just fast.
              I was the fastest in the entire school. District-level tournaments? Won many.
              Lost count? Also yes. Speed taught me one thing early: focus + discipline = results.
            </p>

            <h3>Then Came Control</h3>
            <p>
              Next chapter: Karate. I trained for years and earned my Second Degree Black Belt.
              I competed at district and state levels, winning multiple tournaments.
              Karate taught me control — of body, mind, and ego. You don’t rush. You read. You react.
              Sounds familiar? That’s basically UX research.
            </p>

            <h3>Then I Met Endurance</h3>
            <p>
              Swimming changed everything. I learned to swim in two days. Yes!. In two weeks, I was the fastest in my
              batch.
              I trained every single day — experimenting, pushing limits, testing stamina. Eventually, I moved into
              long-distance swimming.
              At 15 years old, I could swim 2.5 km nonstop — the only person in my hometown who could do it.
            </p>
            <p>
              What amazed me the most was realizing that you can actually feel your sweat in the water —
              but only when you push past what feels comfortable.<br>
              That moment made me stop and think: we humans are incredibly, almost perfectly designed —
              capable of far more than we could think of.

            </p>
            <p>
              I qualified for state-level competitions five times in a row. And five times… I couldn’t attend.
              Family issues. Academic pressure. Life. <br>
              It was frustrating — but it taught me something important: progress still counts, even when the result
              doesn’t show up on paper.
            </p>

            <h3>Leadership on the Field</h3>
            <p>
              At the same time, I was also part of my school football team —
              playing as a midfielder / defender and serving as team captain.
              We won a state-level tournament.
              That’s where I learned leadership isn’t about shouting instructions —
              it’s about reading the game and making space for others to perform.
              Again… very UX.

            </p>

            <h3>The Pause</h3>
            <p>
              After school, life shifted. College. Responsibilities. Distance from sports.
              For almost four years, I played no sports at all.
              But I kept building myself — fitness, strength, discipline, and quiet consistency.
            </p>

            <h3>The Comeback? (Chapter Canada!)</h3>
            <p>
              After moving to Canada, everything restarted. I returned to endurance sports — smarter, calmer, more
              intentional.
              Not chasing medals. Not chasing validation. Just showing up consistently and listening to my body.
            </p>

            <figure class="about-story-image">
              <img src="assets/Sports.png" alt="Football, swimming, cycling, ice skating collage" />
            </figure>

            <p>
              I started ice skating in January 2025. Ottawa is home to the world’s longest skating rink — 7.8 km.
              Today, I can complete the entire stretch in 25 minutes.
            </p>

            <p>
              And let me ask you something —
              Have you ever sweated in –22°C? I have — and believe me, it’s one of the best feelings in the world.
              That moment raised a question in my mind:
              How perfectly were we designed — that our bodies can adapt anywhere, anytime, to almost anything?
            </p>



            <P>From April 2025, I began cycling long distances whenever I get the time.
              My favorite place? Gatineau Park —
              the toughest terrain in the area.
              I choose it because it’s hard.</P>

            <P>
              I’m fascinated by discovering what the human body — and mind — can do
              when pushed gently, consistently, and with intent.
              The more I experience this, the more I understand a belief that deeply resonates with me —
              that out of all the beautiful mountains, rivers, and oceans,
              The Creator says humans are the finest creation.
              As stated in the Qur’an:
            </P>

            <p class="about-quran">
              “We have certainly created man in the best of stature.”<br>
              <span>— Qur’an, 95:4</span>
            </p>
            <p>And maybe that’s why I live the way I do —
              to explore that potential,
              to respect the design,
              and to see how far patience, discipline, and belief can take a person.</p>
            <h3>How this all Connects to my Career</h3>
            <p>
              All of this shaped how I design. I don’t panic under pressure. I observe before acting.
              I respect limits — but I’m not afraid to test them. UX isn’t just pixels and flows.
              It’s patience, empathy, endurance, and iteration.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="about-quran about-quote about-quote-end">
              <p>
                “True design — like life — isn’t about avoiding friction.<br>
                It’s about understanding it well enough to move through it with intention.”
              </p>
