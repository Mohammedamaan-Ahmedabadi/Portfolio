              Youth participation in Ottawa’s city-run recreation programs is low, especially in five key neighborhoods.
              Through research with youth aged 18–25, we identified three main barriers: limited access to affordable
              spaces, rigid programming, and poor communication. To address this, we proposed a three-phase intervention
              focused on improving outreach, co-designing services with youth, and building long-term community hubs to
              foster connection and belonging.

          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            Despite significant government investment in recreation, many young Canadians still face barriers to
            participation. In Ottawa, youth aged 18–25 in five priority neighbourhoods—Britannia, Carlington, Lower
            Town, Overbrook, and Sandy Hill—are especially underrepresented in city-run programs. These areas are home
            to many newcomers and post-secondary students, groups often facing challenges like cost, time constraints,
            and lack of tailored programming. This research explores the factors that discourage youth participation,
            how the city communicates its offerings, and what young people value in recreational experiences.

          <h2>Problem Space</h2>
          <p>
            The City of Ottawa faces declining youth participation (ages 18-25) in recreational programs across priority
            neighborhoods, despite evidence that recreation supports youth development, mental health, and community
            bonds. This raises the critical question: What factors facilitate an interactive and social experience
            amongst urban youth? The current situation reveals a fundamental disconnect between municipal recreation
            offerings and the actual needs, preferences, and experiences of urban youth, necessitating a reimagined
            approach to both program design and outreach strategies through more inclusive, youth-centered methods.

            <p>A mixed-methods approach was used to collect both qualitative and quantitative data from youth aged 18 to
              25 residing in urban Ottawa. The study was divided into three phases to obtain the data: </p>
            <p>Phase 1 involved a screener survey.
              <br>Phase 2 consisted of semi-structured interviews with participants and Subject Matter Experts (SME).

            Our survey gathered 72 responses from the target demographic of youth aged 18-25, with 80% of respondents
            identifying as students or employed students. Notably, the majority of participants resided in the
            priority-focused neighborhoods, providing valuable insight into the recreational needs and preferences of
            our target audience in these specific communities.

                In their leisure time, our survey respondents demonstrated diverse recreational preferences. Team sports
                emerged as the most popular choice with 35% of youth indicating this as their preferred activity.
                Fitness and conditioning activities followed at 26%, while individual solo activities and creative arts
                tied at 14% each. Aquatic sports rounded out the preferences at 11%. This distribution highlights the
                importance of offering varied recreational options that cater to different interests within the youth
                demographic.

          <p>Our survey revealed a significant communication gap between the City of Ottawa and its youth population. A
            striking 60% of respondents were completely unaware of recreation programs offered by the city. Among the
            minority who did know about these programs (35%), most discovered them through informal channels such as
            friends and family, schools, or word of mouth rather than through official city outreach. When asked about
            their preferred communication platforms, respondents overwhelmingly chose social media as the optimal
            outreach method, with Instagram specifically identified as the most effective channel to reach this
            demographic. These findings highlight a critical disconnect in how program information is currently being
            disseminated to youth aged 18-25.</p>

          <div class="cs-bullets" >
            <p>Our findings revealed three major gaps between the city and its youth:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Social Spaces:</strong> Many recreational spaces are not easily accessible or budget-friendly,
                making participation difficult.</li>
              <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Youth often have unpredictable schedules due to school and work.
                Programs that lack flexibility create barriers to participation.</li>
              <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> There is limited awareness of available programs. Youth mainly rely on
                social media and word-of-mouth, yet current outreach strategies don’t effectively use these channels.

          <p class="cs-lead">

              community centers to better engage youth through co-creation, active participation, and the cultivation of
              a strong sense of belonging. Each phase builds on the previous to ensure sustainable growth and deeper
              connections between youth and the city’s recreational spaces—both physical and digital. The journey begins
              by raising awareness and boosting initial participation and culminates in the creation of a hybrid

              its specific context, creating a structure that encourages active youth participation in shaping the
              seasonal recreational offerings tailored to their needs and preferences. The toolkit includes three core
              components: </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Scheduling & Planning Guide:</strong> A customizable planning calendar that helps each
                facility align staff efforts and organize seasonal programming activities efficiently and strategically.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Co-Creation Guide:</strong> A step-by-step guide for designing and facilitating co-creation
                workshops with youth, focusing on inclusive practices, meaningful participation, and collaborative
                decision-making.</li>
              <li><strong>Engagement Guide:</strong> This section outlines how to design compelling campaigns, select
                the right communication channels, and build partnerships to effectively promote the new youth-driven
                programs.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As co-creation initiatives gain momentum, the youth engagement group grows stronger—inviting more young
              people to get involved. In this phase, the scope of collaboration expands beyond programming. Youth begin
              to contribute ideas for improvements to infrastructure, equipment, virtual platforms, and communication
              strategies within their community centers. The result is a deeper sense of ownership and social
              connection, where youth not only participate in programs but also influence the direction of their
              development. This inclusive and responsive approach encourages older youth (18–25) to serve as role models
              and catalysts for engaging younger audiences, fostering an intergenerational culture of participation and
              empowerment. Additionally, this phase emphasizes upgrading the digital platform, ensuring that program
              information is accessible, relevant, and aligned with how youth prefer to discover and engage with
              recreational opportunities.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The final phase establishes a true “Third Place” for youth in Ottawa—a space that exists beyond home and
              school/work, where young people feel welcomed, seen, and connected. Each community center becomes a
              recognizable spot in the city where youth feel a strong sense of belonging, supported by a physical
              environment shaped by their input. This experience is enhanced by a dedicated digital space on the city’s
              recreation platform, where youth can create groups, share stories, organize activities, and showcase their
              community impact. It becomes more than a place to sign up for programs—it’s a living hub of connection,
              creativity, and community that supports ongoing engagement and visibility for youth voices. <br><br>

          <h2>Limitations</h2>
          <p>
            The main constraint within this research was the researchers' inability to conduct interviews with
            participants who took part in the City of Ottawa recreational programs. Advisors who have experience with
            the City of Ottawa recreational programs could supply beneficial guidance about program-specific obstacles
            and thus expand research depth. The brief collection period and narrow scope of the study limited
            researchers from conducting extensive analysis. Future researchers should study how web interface design and
            workflow functionality affect user engagement and experience. Research into "third places" as informal
            public spaces away from home and work could help understand how to build community ties and improve urban
            social health. Future research should concentrate on studying these regions because they provide substantial
            opportunities for study and progress.

          <h2>Learning</h2>
          <p>
            Throughout this study, I developed and refined several critical professional skills that have enhanced my
            design practice. I strengthened my storytelling abilities—both visual and verbal—learning to effectively
            communicate complex user needs and system relationships to diverse stakeholders. Working with system design
            methodologies allowed me to visualize interconnected elements within the recreational ecosystem and identify
            key intervention points. Additionally, I gained valuable experience creating toolkit frameworks that empower
            community center staff with practical resources they can implement immediately. This project reinforced the
            importance of translating research insights into actionable tools that facilitate real-world change while
            balancing theoretical approaches with practical implementation considerations.
