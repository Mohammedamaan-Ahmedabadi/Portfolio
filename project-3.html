          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            Transitioning into college life can be both exciting and overwhelming—especially for new students at
            Algonquin College. For international students, the challenge is often greater as they adjust not only to
            academic expectations but also to a new culture, environment, and support systems. Managing time effectively
            becomes crucial for balancing academic responsibilities, part-time work, and personal life.

            <br><br>To support student success, Algonquin College provides a variety of digital calendars that outline
            academic schedules, campus events, and other key activities. While these resources are intended to help
            students stay organized, new students may not always find them intuitive or easy to use. Navigating between
            multiple calendars, understanding their specific purposes, and integrating them into daily planning can be a
            confusing experience—especially during the critical early weeks of the semester.

                Despite the availability of college-provided calendars, many new students face challenges in effectively
                using them to manage their academic and extracurricular responsibilities. This is particularly true for
                international students who may be less familiar with the systems and expectations of post-secondary
                education in Canada.

                To understand how new students at Algonquin College engage with college-provided calendars,
                we used a mixed-method approach combining surveys and interviews.
              </p>

              <h3 class="cs-method-phase">Phase 1: Survey</h3>
              <p>
                We began with a short survey designed to gather quantitative insights and screen participants for
                interviews.
                The survey included a consent form and was shared through posters, student groups, and in-person
                outreach.
                Our goal was to collect 100 responses from Level 1 students.
              </p>

              <h3 class="cs-method-phase">Phase 2: Semi-Structured Interviews</h3>
              <p>
                From the survey respondents, we selected participants for in-depth, semi-structured interviews to
                explore
                their experiences in more detail. We aimed to conduct 10 interviews. Each session was led by one
                interviewer
                and one notetaker, with participant permission to record the conversation for accuracy and analysis.
              </p>

              <p class="cs-method-outro">
                This approach allowed us to gather both broad trends and personal insights to better understand the
                calendar
                usage experience from a student perspective.

            This research focused on first-semester students at Algonquin College, as they are best positioned to share
            early experiences with the college's calendar system.
            We collected survey responses from 126 new students to understand general patterns and challenges. From this

                Calendar usage varied: 35 students checked the college calendar daily, while others used it weekly or
                occasionally.
                Brightspace was the most recognized and used tool, followed by ACSIS and the Pulse app. Awareness of
                other platforms
                like ICENT, IEC Calendar, and Outlook was significantly lower.

                Brightspace, Pulse, and ACSIS were the most preferred tools, but satisfaction levels were generally low.
                Around 60% of students expressed dissatisfaction or neutrality toward the current systems, highlighting
                a need

                with
                10 first-semester students (2 domestic, 8 international). Key themes emerged around how students manage

              <p class="blue">
                Students strive to balance academics, extracurriculars, and personal life, often prioritizing immediate
                tasks
                over long-term planning. International students, in particular, emphasized the importance of integrating
                into

            <h4>Fragmented Tools</h4>
            <p>
              Students use a mix of physical and digital tools—planners, apps, notes, and widgets—which often leads to
              disorganization. The lack of integration across platforms creates confusion and extra effort to manage
              their

              Participants highlighted the need for a centralized system that syncs academic and personal commitments
              across
              devices. Current tools like Brightspace don’t integrate well with personal calendars, resulting in missed
              deadlines and added stress.

              confusion.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Accessibility</strong> Navigation and usability of current calendar tools should be
              enhanced, especially on mobile. Clear onboarding, intuitive interfaces, and better compatibility will
              reduce reliance on memory or informal methods like handwritten notes.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible Scheduling Tools</strong> Students benefit from dynamic scheduling features such as
              drag-and-drop task management, weekly views, and built-in collaboration tools. Flexibility is key to
              handling varied academic and personal responsibilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual & Interactive Elements</strong> Incorporating visual aids—like progress bars, timeline
              views, and reminders—can boost user engagement. Pulse app features stood out and could inspire
              enhancements across all calendar platforms.</li>

          <h2>Limitations</h2>
          <p>
            While this study offers useful insights, there are a few limitations to consider. Most participants were
            international students, with limited input from domestic students—meaning the findings may not fully reflect
            the broader student population. Additionally, the small sample size and absence of subject matter expert
            (SME) perspectives may limit the depth and generalizability of the results. Responses were also influenced
            by personal experiences, which could introduce bias.

          <h2>Learning</h2>
          <p>
            This project highlighted the complexity students face in managing multiple calendars and how fragmented
            tools can impact their academic and personal balance. I learned the value of combining surveys with
            interviews to uncover both broad trends and deeper user insights. It reinforced the importance of designing
            centralized, user-friendly solutions with flexible and visual features tailored to students' needs. Most
            importantly, it taught me that even simple tools like calendars require thoughtful, user-centered design to
            truly support the people using them.
